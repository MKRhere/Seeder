# Seeder

Seeder is a way to quickly seed a database (or repeat any action) based on [JSONT](https://github.com/codefeathers/jsont).

This is an MVP implementation. Docs will be published soon.

If you're looking for the previous module published under the name, install version `0.2.0`, or check the git repo [here](https://github.com/AnyFetch/seeder.js).

Thanks to [Neamar](https://github.com/Neamar) and [AnyFetch](https://github.com/AnyFetch) for donating the npm package name.
